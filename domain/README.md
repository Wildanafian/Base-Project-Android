# Domain Module

### Overview

This Domain Module is designed to encapsulate and consolidate multiple repositories into a single,
reusable use case.

Currently, the use case is grouped by feature module (ex = HomeUsecase will only be used in feature:
home...etc). But you could do it with your own way.

### Note

- Use Domain Model / Mapped Model to expose data to UI layer
